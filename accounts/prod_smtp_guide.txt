Configuring a SMTP Email Service
First remove the EMAIL_BACKEND from your settings.py, since it defaults to SMTP Email Backend.

Now add the information from your email provider:

It looks like something like this:
Inside settings.py
	EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.sendgrid.net'
	EMAIL_PORT = 587
	EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'testsite_app'
	EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'mys3cr3tp4ssw0rd'
	EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
	DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'TestSite Team <noreply@example.com>'

	There are many transactional email services out there. SendGrid, MailGun, Mandrill.
